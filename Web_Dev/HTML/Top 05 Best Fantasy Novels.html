            <p><strong>Personal Opinion : </strong> The story, plot, character design and the flow are all mangnificantly done.Especially the MC's personality is sharp, quick wittied and hungry for more power, knowledge and levelling up to the next stage.....it

            <img src="pics\SCOG.jpg" alt="tlm">
            <p><strong>Summery : </strong> Unforgivable. Trash. Son of bitch. Such words are the only ones worthy enough to describe the man known as Seol. A gambling addict who forgoed his responsibilities, betrayed his family, lover and himself, Seol was
                someone who ruined his life with his own hands. Even when he ran away to another world, he only continued down his path of failure. With his dying breath on foreign soil, he makes a wish to start over from the beginning. Returning to the
                lowest point of his life, accompanied by emotions from a fleeting dream of the past future and a now restored ability to see the path of fate, Seol narrowly avoids the choice that would have resulted in his total ruin once again. Now once
                more setting foot in the other world known as the Lost Paradise, Seol attempts to pave a new path, one without regret, and to atone for his sins back on Earth. But redemption never comes so simply, and only through hard-work and suffering
                may Seol find a chance to truly change himself.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Opinion : </strong> The story and drama in this novel is one of the best i've ever seen....the story, the plot are terrifyingly intense but at the same time breadth taking...the action sequences and the level of detailed writing
                deserves and standing ovation...The MC is kinda Pathetic sometimes but hes pretty good and grows stronger and sharper constantly.....character design and the rest is worth mentoning....this my 2nd best novel so far</p>

                anything if it means benefits. He is cold, ruthless and calculating, never forming attachments that could impede his ultimate goal…</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Opinion : </strong>The MC is rutheless and super ambitious...the story and plot is crazy good....the theme is pretty dark mostly related to warlock characteristics and alchemy....the character design and overall flow of the
                story is pretty bloody and insanly good...</p>
        </div>

            <h3> 4.Lord Of Mystries</h3>

                Potions, Divination, </p>
            <p><strong>Personal Opinion : </strong>The story and plot is pretty crazy...the suspense element is the strongest and drives you crazy....the MC is pretty good...but the best thing of this novel is the unpredictable plots the will make you mouth
                hang wide open....the theme here is very dark and has a lot of horrofic sequences....its borderline horror....and bloody good</p>

            <h3> 5.Abel The Wizard</h3>
            <img src="pics\abe-the-wizard-wn.jpg" alt="tlm">
            <p><strong>Summery : </strong> I was reincarnated into another world, and I’ve brought the Horadric Cube from Diablo II with me. Being a knight is cool and all, but being a wizard is pretty neat as well. So, which one will it be?</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Opinion : </strong> The story and plot is pretty good...the theme is similar to the legandary mechanic....but the MC is litrally OP...he's like all in one package of all the best things in the story....the character growth
                is really good.....MC's character is family loving and litrally like a giving tree but he's super ambitious and ruthless enemy to his foes....but its good</p>

                with the feelings of the dying NPC and his own heartrending events in the game, he sets out to change the fate of a kingdom that was doomed to tragedy.</p>
            <p><strong>Personal Opinion : </strong>This novel is also pretty good somewhat similar to able the wizard but the MC is not that op...his character grows gradually with the flow of the story...the story and plots are very good and unique...the
                characater design is also pretty nice....but the most best part of this novel is the MC's power as a planeswalker that makes this very unique....its pretty good and the story is quite vast and intresting....</p>
